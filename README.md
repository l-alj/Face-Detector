# Face-Detector

Built a facial detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically Siamese neural networks, implemented with Python, TensorFlow Functional API, and OpenCV.  Developed by training the Siamese neural network model, which is specialized in comparing pairs of facial images to understand their similarities and differences. I collected positive and anchor images to train the model to distinguish between specific individuals effectively. Preprocessed the collected images by scaling and resizing to ensure uniformity in input data, optimizing the model's performance.

Designed the Siamese neural network with implementation of custom loss functions and optimizers. Tested the neural networkâ€™s performance to check that it accurately detects and distinguishes between faces.
